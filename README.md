# DEB ontology

The devices, experimental scaffolds, and biomaterials ontology (DEB) is an open resource for organizing information about biomaterials, their design, manufacture, and biological testing. It was developed using text analysis for identifying ontology terms from a biomaterials [gold standard corpus](gold_standard_set), systematically curated to represent the domain's lexicon. Topics covered were validated by members of the biomaterials research community. The ontology may be used for searching terms, performing annotations for machine learning applications, standardized meta‐data indexing, and other cross‐disciplinary data exploitation. The input of the biomaterials community to this effort to create data‐driven open‐access research tools is encouraged and welcomed. 

## Contributing to the ontology

We strive to make DEB as complete as possible, so suggestions for new terms and improvements are welcome!

Suggesting a new DEB term:

1. Check on [Bioportal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/DEB) if the term already exists 

2. Gather as much necessary information as possible: New term label (required) Definition (required) The superclass under which it should appear (required) Where the term has been used (e.g.: a link to an abstract) Synonyms

3. Communicate with the DEB team: Creat an 'issue' using on of the following titles: Suggestion for a term clarifying term definition Adding synonyms Changing the position of a term in the DEB ontology

4. Please create an issue for each proposed change

We welcome contributions from experts in any area of biomaterials, tissue engineeting and medical devices!
