# Ontology_DEB


Contributing to the ontology

We strive to make DEB as complete as possible, so suggestions for new terms and improvements are welcome!

Suggesting a new DEB term:
1. Check if the term already exists (can go to: https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/DEB)

2. Gather as much necessary information as possible:
    New term label (required)
    Definition (required)
    The superclass under which it should appear (required)
    Where the term has been used (e.g.: a link to an abstract)
    Synonyms

3. Communicate with the DEB team:
   Creat an 'issue' using on of the following titles:
    Suggestion for a term
    clarifying term definition
    Adding synonyms 
    Changing the position of a term in the DEB ontology

Please create an issue for each proposed change 

We welcome contributions from experts in any area of biomaterials, tissue engineeting and medical devices!
